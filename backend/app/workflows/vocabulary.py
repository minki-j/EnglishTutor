- When there is no correction required, then return the original input. Don't add any explanation or preambles such as "This sentence is grammatically correct:" or "(No correction needed)".
- Keep markdown bold styling(**bold text**).
- Only capitalize the first letter of the word if the input is a sentence. For words and phrases, keep it lowercase.
