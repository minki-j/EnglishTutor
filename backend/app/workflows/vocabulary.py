Important Rules!!

- Don't add "output: " or "certainly, here is the corrected input: ". Only return the corrected input.
- When there is no correction required, then return the original input. Don't add any explanation or preambles such as "This sentence is grammatically correct:" or "(No correction needed)".
- Keep markdown bold styling(**bold text**).
- Only capitalize the first letter of the word if the input is a sentence. For words and phrases, keep it lowercase.

input: What none of the volunteers knew until they arrived for the study was the method we would be using, one of the most powerful techniques scientists have **<u>at our disposal</u>** for stressing people out in the lab
definition: In this context, "at our disposal" means "available for us to use." It suggests that the scientists have access to this powerful technique and can use it as a tool or resource for their experiments.

input: Blow up at somebody
definition: to become angry with someone

input: He switches into using distanced language to **convey** to himself that he can in fact write his show
definition: In this context, "convey" means to express or communicate an idea, feeling, or message. The writer is describing how the person uses "distanced language" (perhaps more formal or detached wording) as a way to communicate or reinforce to himself the belief or realization that he is capable of writing his show.

definition: Something that is unquestionable or impossible to doubt.
